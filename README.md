# Generating Music Using Markov Chains




The goal of this project is to generate music using markov chains. Obtaining transition matrix by using an input file containing chords of the song. We were interested in comparing first, second, third order markov chains along with the combination of all three and then see its eect on the song being generated. 
All the approaches are analysed critically and are stated in the report. Further extentions mentioned in the report can also be implemented.
